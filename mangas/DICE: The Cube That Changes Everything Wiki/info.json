  "description": "[Complete]\nDongtae, a bullied, unpopular high schooler who gets a chance to transform his life when a mysterious transfer student, Taebin, introduces him to magical dice that grant wishes and skills with each roll, but quickly becomes a dark, addictive game where appearance, status, and even fighting power are altered, leading Dongtae down a complex path filled with unforeseen consequences, moral dilemmas, and battles against other \"Dicers\" who seek power, questioning if true change is possible or just a game.",
